        History of Pickleball
Pickleball began in 1965 by three pals, Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum, on Bainbridge Island, Washington. They formed the game for family fun, using ping-pong paddles and a plastic ball on a badminton court. The sport grew fast. They lowered the net to 36 inches and created specific rules for play. By 1972, a group formed to safeguard the sport, marking the first known tournament in the same year. Nowadays, pickleball is one of the quickest expanding sports in the U.S. and its popularity is spreading globally. 

Basic Rules of Pickleball
1. Court and Gear: It’s played on a badminton-sized area measuring 20 by 44 feet with a net standing 36 inches high on the sides and 34 inches in the middle. Players use paddles and a ball that has holes.
2. Serve: The serve needs an underhand motion, paddle below the waist, and must be aimed diagonally into the opponent's designated service area.
3. Two-Bounce Rule: The ball has to bounce once on each side before players can hit it in mid-air without waiting for it to bounce first.
4. Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen): Players can’t strike the ball while positioned in the non-volley zone, which is a 7-foot space beside the net.
5. Scoring: Points are scored only by the serving side. Games are usually played to 11 points, requiring a team to win by a margin of 2 points.

Benefits of Playing Pickleball
1. Heart Health: Pickleball offers a quality workout, boosting cardiovascular health and stamina. 
2. Strength Gains: The game involves many actions that build muscle and bone strength, lowering osteoporosis risk. 
3. Balance and Coordination: Quick moves and coordination during play sharpen balance and help prevent falls. 
4. Mental Well-being: The social nature of the game can lower stress and enhance mood, aiding overall mental health.  
5. For Everyone: Pickleball is easy to grasp. It’s suitable for all ages and fitness levels, making it a fun way to stay active.

      <h3>How to get started</h3>
      <p>
        Gear Required

        1. Paddles: Pickleball paddles are not as big as tennis racquets but larger than ping-pong paddles. They’re made from different materials like wood, composite, and graphite which give different power and control.  
        2. Balls: Pickleballs are hollow plastic spheres, kinda like wiffle balls. They come in two types: indoor balls are softer and have bigger holes; outdoor balls are harder.  
        3. Court: The game takes place on a badminton-sized area (20' by 44') with a net measuring 36 inches at the sides and 34 inches in the middle. Proper shoes are suggested for safety while playing.  
        
        Advice for Newbies  
        
        1. Understand the Fundamentals: Start by learning the key rules and strokes, like serving underhand and the two-bounce principle.  
        2. Practice Often: Regular practice boosts your abilities. Try drills for specific shots such as dinks and volleys.  
        3. Be Patient: The game may feel tough at first. Take your time to learn; don't be upset by early mistakes.  
        4. Observe and Absorb: Watching skilled players gives you helpful tips on strategies and methods.  
        5. Enjoy Yourself: Keep in mind to have a good time and appreciate the social side of the game.

        Pickleball Rules & Guidelines 

        Specific rules of the game  
        1. Serving: When you serve, use an underhand motion with the paddle held below your waist. Aim diagonally into the opponent’s area for serving. You only get one chance to serve each time.  
        2. Two-Bounce Principle: The ball has to bounce once on both sides before anyone can hit it in the air.  
        3. Non-Volley Space (Kitchen): You can't hit the ball while in the 7-foot no-volley zone by the net.  
        4. Errors: Common mistakes involve stepping into the no-volley area during a hit, sending the ball outside the play area, or serving improperly.  
        
        Scoring Format  
        1. Traditional Side-Out Scoring: Only the team that's serving can score. Games usually go to 11 points, and a team needs to lead by 2 to win.  
        2. Announcing the Score: Call it out as three numbers: the serving team’s score, the receiving team's score, and whether it’s server 1 or 2.  
        
        Common Mistakes and Fixes  
        1. Foot Faults: This happens when you step over the line to serve or into the no-volley zone while hitting. Stay aware of your feet and practice where you position them.  
        2. Out-of-Bounds Hits: Sending the ball outside the court’s limits can happen easily. Keep your focus on control and make sure your shots land inside the lines.  
        3. Service Mistakes: Serving into the net or out of bounds is common. Work on your serve to enhance precision and get consistent.

        Advanced Skills and Methods  
        1. Use a Strategic Approach: Change your game plan based on what your opponent is good at or weak in. For instance, you could hit towards their weaker backhand.  
        2. Enhance Contact Point Skills: Get good at hitting from different areas to gain better control of your shots.  
        3. Counteract Fast Attacks: Employ gentle blocks to slow down the match and take back control.
