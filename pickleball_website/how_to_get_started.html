          <h3>Gear Required</h3>
          <p>
            1. Paddles: Pickleball paddles are not as big as tennis racquets but larger than ping-pong paddles. They’re made from different materials like wood, composite, and graphite which give different power and control.  
            <br>2. Balls: Pickleballs are hollow plastic spheres, kinda like wiffle balls. They come in two types: indoor balls are softer and have bigger holes; outdoor balls are harder.  
            <br>3. Court: The game takes place on a badminton-sized area (20' by 44') with a net measuring 36 inches at the sides and 34 inches in the middle. Proper shoes are suggested for safety while playing.</p>
            <h3>Advice for Newbies</h3>

                <br>3. Be Patient: The game may feel tough at first. Take your time to learn; don't be upset by early mistakes.  
                <br>4. Observe and Absorb: Watching skilled players gives you helpful tips on strategies and methods.  
                <br>5. Enjoy Yourself: Keep in mind to have a good time and appreciate the social side of the game. </p>
