            <h3>Specic rules of the game</h3>
            <p>
                1. Serving: When you serve, use an underhand motion with the paddle held below your waist. Aim diagonally into the opponent’s area for serving. You only get one chance to serve each time.  
                <br>2. Two-Bounce Principle: The ball has to bounce once on both sides before anyone can hit it in the air.  
                <br>3. Non-Volley Space (Kitchen): You can't hit the ball while in the 7-foot no-volley zone by the net.  
                <br>4. Errors: Common mistakes involve stepping into the no-volley area during a hit, sending the ball outside the play area, or serving improperly.

            <h3>Common Mistakes and Fixes</h3>
    <p>
        1. Foot Faults: This happens when you step over the line to serve or into the no-volley zone while hitting. Stay aware of your feet and practice where you position them.  
        <br>2. Out-of-Bounds Hits: Sending the ball outside the court’s limits can happen easily. Keep your focus on control and make sure your shots land inside the lines.  
        <br>3. Service Mistakes: Serving into the net or out of bounds is common. Work on your serve to enhance precision and get consistent.

        <h3>Scoring Format</h3>
        <p>
        1. Traditional Side-Out Scoring: Only the team that's serving can score. Games usually go to 11 points, and a team needs to lead by 2 to win.  
        <br>2. Announcing the Score: Call it out as three numbers: the serving team’s score, the receiving team's score, and whether it’s server 1 or 2.
