They formed the game for family fun, using ping-pong paddles and a plastic ball on a badminton court. The sport grew fast. They lowered the net to 36 inches and created specific rules for play. By 1972, a group formed to safeguard the sport, marking the first known tournament in the same year. Nowadays, pickleball is one of the quickest expanding sports in the U.S. and its popularity is spreading globally.'; /* The text */

<h3>Basic Rules of Pickleball</h3>
<p>
    1. Court and Gear: It’s played on a badminton-sized area measuring 20 by 44 feet with a net standing 36 inches high on the sides and 34 inches in the middle. Players use paddles and a ball that has holes.
    <br>2. Serve: The serve needs an underhand motion, paddle below the waist, and must be aimed diagonally into the opponent's designated service area.
    <br>3. Two-Bounce Rule: The ball has to bounce once on each side before players can hit it in mid-air without waiting for it to bounce first.
    <br>4. Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen): Players can’t strike the ball while positioned in the non-volley zone, which is a 7-foot space beside the net.
    <br>5. Scoring: Points are scored only by the serving side. Games are usually played to 11 points, requiring a team to win by a margin of 2 points.</p>
